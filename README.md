Technohacks Internship projectgs

I implemented 3 projects within one month of training.
The first project was  iris classification  .
In this project I learned how to collect data,  feature scaling, deal with outliers, and train and evaluate models.
The second project was diabetes prediction, and it was a regression problem
In this project you learned how to handle missing values ​​using custom values, feature scaling, model comparison, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
The third and final project was cifar-10-image-classification:
In this project I learned about neural network, CNN, feature scaling, label encoding, pre-trained models, fine-tuning and visualizing model performance
